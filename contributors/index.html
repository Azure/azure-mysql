          <b>The Azure Database for MySQL Contributor program</b> recognizes Azure Database for MySQL community members who actively support one another by sharing Azure MySQL-related content, announcements, and product news via social media channels. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
            Azure Database for MySQL Contributors range in expertise and engagement level, but they all share one common goal—<b>to help others get connected and expand their knowledge of Azure Database for MySQL</b>. This would include MySQL community members, Azure Database for MySQL users and customers, MySQL influencers, Microsoft MVPs and partners, Microsoft internal members (GBBs, CSAs, CSS team members, Solution Specialists, Sellers, Consultants and FastTrack team engineers who help with migrations, etc.). In addition to recognizing users who regularly create and post content, this program encourages new users to get involved in community discussions.
